# qsort
Task #2 of the lecture Advanced Programming 2020

## Usage

Include the header `qsort.h` and use the function `qsort` as standard C library.

## Test Building

Run `make` to build two default targets `double_test` and `integer_test`.

`double_test` sorts n real numbers while `integer_test` sorts n pairs of integer.

Run `make clean` to clean targets built.

## Performance

Currently **far worse** than standard C library.
